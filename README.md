# Current-Localised-Weather-App

## The Project

The page shows gets geolocation data through the IP-API and then displays local weather information to the user through data pulled from the Open Weather API in JSON format.

Displays city, temperature, wind direction and wind speed. Displays a different background based on the current weather type (e.g. rain, cloud, sun snow). Our American friends also have the ability to change the units displayed from celcius for temperature and kph for windspeed to fahrenheit and mph.
